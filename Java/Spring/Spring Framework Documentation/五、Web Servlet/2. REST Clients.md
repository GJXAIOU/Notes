## 2. REST Clients

This section describes options for client-side access to REST endpoints.

### 2.1. `RestTemplate`

`RestTemplate` is a synchronous client to perform HTTP requests. It is the original Spring REST client and exposes a simple, template-method API over underlying HTTP client libraries.

|      | As of 5.0 the `RestTemplate` is in maintenance mode, with only minor requests for changes and bugs to be accepted going forward. Please, consider using the [WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-client) which offers a more modern API and supports sync, async, and streaming scenarios. |

See [REST Endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#rest-client-access) for details.

### 2.2. `WebClient`

`WebClient` is a non-blocking, reactive client to perform HTTP requests. It was introduced in 5.0 and offers a modern alternative to the `RestTemplate`, with efficient support for both synchronous and asynchronous, as well as streaming scenarios.

In contrast to `RestTemplate`, `WebClient` supports the following:

- Non-blocking I/O.
- Reactive Streams back pressure.
- High concurrency with fewer hardware resources.
- Functional-style, fluent API that takes advantage of Java 8 lambdas.
- Synchronous and asynchronous interactions.
- Streaming up to or streaming down from a server.

See [WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-client) for more details.
